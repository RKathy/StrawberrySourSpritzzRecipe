"Vanilla, black pepper and lemon are three flavors that both ripe strawberries and whisky love. Here they provide a bridge between the two in the long vibrant version of a whisky sour"

INGREDIENTS
1kg of strawberries, 900g hulled and halved, rest for garnish
600ml soda
300ml Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve
2 1/2 tbs caster sugar
2 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
5 lemons
1 tsp coarse ground black pepper (optional). Sieve oﬀ dust before using.
Ice

METHOD
1. Remove the rind in strips from two lemons leaving as much of the bitter pith behind as you can. A sharp veg peeler is great for this job. Reserve on damp kitchen towel.

2. In batches, place the strawberries in a cocktail shaker or straight-sided jug and muddle with the caster sugar and vanilla extract (1tsp of sugar and 1/4tsp of vanilla for each 100g of strawberries). Muddle together so the strawberries free their juiciness and break down.

3. Juice the lemons onto the strawberries (the juice of half a lemon for each 100g of strawberries). Mix.

4. Add the whisky and shake if you’ve got a shaker or stir well if you haven’t.

5. Pour the strawberry mix over ice, top with soda to taste, stir and finally garnish with a little black pepper, a twisted slice of lemon peel, and a slice of strawberry.
